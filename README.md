##  Task  
The objective of this assignment is to apply machine learning techniques to predict the onset of
diabetes in individuals based on various features. Students will propose, implement, and
evaluate machine learning models to accurately predict the status of diabetes development in
patients.  

## Dataset:  
A dataset containing various health metrics and
demographic information of individuals, with the target variable being the presence or absence
of diabetes. The main tasks include of the followings:  
  
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
● Perform thorough exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of
features, identify correlations, and visualize patterns in the dataset.  
● Handle missing values, outliers, and perform necessary data preprocessing steps.  
  
## Model Proposal:  
● Propose at least three different machine learning models suitable for predicting
the status of diabetes development in patients (only use techniques taught in class
up to week 5 - inclusive).  
● Justify the selection of each model based on its strengths, weaknesses, and
suitability for the task.  
  
## Model Implementation:  
● Implement the proposed machine learning models using appropriate libraries (e.g.,
scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.).  
● Fine-tune hyperparameters using cross-validation techniques to optimize model
performance.  
  
## Model Evaluation:  
● Submit the prediction for patients in a given test set whose dependent variable (i.e.,
the presence or absence of diabetes) is hidden  
  
## Discussion and Conclusion:  
● Provide a detailed discussion on the effectiveness of different machine learning
models for diabetes prediction.  
● Discuss the implications of the findings and potential applications of the predictive
models in healthcare settings.  
● Highlight areas for future research or improvements in predictive modeling for
diabetes.
